init -- Interactively create a homework assignment
==================================================

## SYNOPSIS

    homework init

## DESCRIPTION

This will ask you a bunch of questions, and then scaffold a homework assignment for you.

If you already have a .homework.json file, it'll read that first, and default to
the options in there.

It is strictly additive, so it does not delete options from your .homework.json
without a really good reason to do so.
